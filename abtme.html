                    Hi! my name is Treya and I'm currently studying in 12th grade.
                I'm a sixteen y/o artist who has an immense passion for music.
                I play the guitar, piano and the uke, while also training my vocals in both western and carnatic music. I have a distinction in Trinity College of Music Theory and the same in KSEEEB jr. carnatic music vocals. 
                To help expand my music and connect with people, I started a youtube channel in 2020 where I love to experiment with my creative side. I also enjoy public speaking and debating, and have taken part in various events that help me connect with people and causes.
                Apart from arts, I'm a science enthusiast! I love researching and innovating on the never ending stream of possibilities of this world and hope to use this passion as a driving force in the future. I believe Computer Science is the driving force of our future, but I also believe that in order to achieve success, we must use our resources wisely. I want to help revolutionise this industry and integrate it with helping mankind and humanity. I want to use this extraordinary tool to build a better world, rather than tear it apart like we are doing now. My ultimate dream is to work for the United Nations and educate people and make their world a better one, all by using the vital aid of technology
